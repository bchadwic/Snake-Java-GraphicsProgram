<h2>Freetime project: 2D game of snake using acm's GraphicsProgram</h2>
<p>I started this project to test my ability to make a graphical game.</p>
<ul>The game is finished but there are a few things I would like to add such as:
<li>Make the game more object-oriented and less procedural</li>
<li>Use a different data-structure than an ArrayList, in hopes that it might make the movement faster</li>
<li>Add a separate game menu</li>
<li>Use more streams instead of looping through indices</li>
<li>Create a key-simulator to make the perfect snake bot using Java, or Python</li>
</ul>

<h4>Current project:</h4>
<p>Working on the key-simulator / snake bot using Robot</p>
